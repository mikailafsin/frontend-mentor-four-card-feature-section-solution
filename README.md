## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I gained more control over using the `box-shadow` property.


```css
.card {
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -20px var(--blue-clr);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I will practice more about the `box-shadow` property and focus on supporting the practice with different variations.
